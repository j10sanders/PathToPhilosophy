# themuse 2.0

Clearly the Muse needed a UI overhaul :wink:

I made this job search app by utilizing the Muse's public API.  Improvements I could add:

1. More testing.  I would prefer to do TDD but I just wanted to get a working example up.  There are some basic tests included, but they aren't covering much.
2. Better style -- I basically just copied their font and used some of the same colors.  That isn't enough to really be on-brand (but that wasn't my goal).
3. Make use of Javascript to display the results on one page, so they can be dynamically updated with each criteria selection.
